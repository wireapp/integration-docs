# SDK Overview

### Why use the SDK
- Handles authentication for you
- Provides event handling
- Makes sending and receiving messages easier
- Strongly typed for Kotlin developers

## Key Characteristics
- **Independent from core code**  
  Apps are not bundled into the frontend or backend binaries. They live outside the main system.

- **Pluggable and flexible**  
  Apps can be added, updated, or removed without requiring a frontend/backend release.

- **User-driven installation**  
  Unlike system features that require admin deployment, apps can often be enabled (installed) directly by end users.

- **Open for third parties**  
  Apps are not limited to our company’s developers — external teams and third parties can build and operate their own apps.
