# Create App

Create an app and get credentials for your integration

## Team requirements

- Team is on paid plan → see [plans and pricing](https://wire.com/pricing) 
- MLS is the default protocol → raise a [support ticket](https://support.wire.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)
- Apps feature flag is enabled → 
  - Cloud: raise a [support ticket](https://support.wire.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)
  - On-Premise: via backoffice
     ```
     https://backoffice.<ENVIRONMENT>.ops.wire.link/swagger-ui/index.html#/default/put-route-apps-config
     ```  
     if you have it installed or by making curl request on Galley pod:
     ```shell
     curl -X 'PUT' \
        'http://localhost:9085/i/teams/<team-id>/features/apps' \
        -H 'accept: application/json;charset=utf-8' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8' \
        -d '{
           "status": "enabled",
           "ttl": "unlimited"
        }'
     ```

For On-Premise installations, you’ll also need to set `FEATURE_ENABLE_APP_CREATION` variable to true 
in values.yaml file in Team Settings and redeploy it.

## On desktop (macOS, Windows, or on Wire for web)

In the app as team owner or admin:

1. Select *Settings*, then select *Manage team* or go to [teams.wire.com](https://teams.wire.com/).
2. Log in with your account credentials:

|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|

5. Add your App details.

6. You’ll see the token once. Save it now.   
   **You won’t be able to view it again.**  
   Both ID and token are required when constructing an SDK instance.

7. After the app is created, you’ll return to the Integrations tab.  
   Select the three dots next to your app, then choose *View details* to find the rest of your credentials: **App ID**, **host**, and **domain**.

## What’s next
Now that you have the credentials, you’re ready to connect your app.
Go to [Quickstart](../01-quickstart-advanced.mdx) to include the SDK in your project and continue setup.
