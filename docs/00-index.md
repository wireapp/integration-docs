# Extend Wire with secure Apps

#### Apps bring your ideas to the [Wire secure communications platform](https://wire.com/)
Automate workflows, connect with third-party services, and boost collaboration.  
Customize Wire to fit your team's needs. All with Wire's end-to-end MLS encryption and security intact.

## How it works

Apps are separate pieces of software that communicate with Wire through a common protocol.  
They remain independent, but can seamlessly interact with the system and its users.

An App is a way to extend and automate your team’s experience on Wire.  
Send and receive messages — including assets, emojis, and interactive buttons — create and manage conversations, and integrate external services.

Apps are owned and managed at the team level. The administrator decides which Apps are installed.

## What's needed

### Develop your App using SDK

The SDK handles authentication for you, notifies about events, and makes sending and receiving messages straightforward.
It’s strongly typed for Kotlin, helping you write safer, more predictable code with less overhead.

➡️ Start right away! [Follow the Quickstart guide](01-quickstart-advanced.mdx).

➡️ Discover [all the ways of interacting with Wire](03-developer-interface/index.mdx).

### Register the App

For identification and secure connection to Wire, your App needs credentials.

Follow the [steps to onboard your App](./02-manage-apps/01-create-app.md).

### Deploy secure apps

You own and host your app, with full control over your infrastructure and data.

Wire never has access to the messages your App receives or sends.

You need to secure your deployment and protect the data your App handles. 
Follow the [secure integration guidelines](05-secure-integration-guidelines/01-security-privacy-basics.md) and review the [deployment tips](04-deployment-tips/index.md).
