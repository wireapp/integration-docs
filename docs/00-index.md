# Extend Wire with secure Apps

Apps bring your ideas to the [Wire secure communications platform](https://wire.com/).  
Automate workflows, connect with third-party services, and boost collaboration.  
Customize Wire to fit your team's needs. All with Wire's end-to-end encryption and security intact.

## How it works

Apps are separate pieces of software that communicate with Wire through a common protocol.  
They remain independent, but can seamlessly interact with the system and its users.

An App is a way to extend and automate your team’s experience on Wire.  
Apps can listen to messages, send responses, and integrate with external services.

Apps are owned and managed at the team level. The administrator decides which Apps are installed.

## What's needed

### Develop your App using SDK

The SDK at a glance:
- Handles authentication for you
- Provides event handling
- Makes sending and receiving messages easier
- Strongly typed for Kotlin developers

➡️ Start right away! [Follow the Quickstart guide](01-quickstart-advanced.mdx).

➡️ Discover [all the ways of interacting with Wire](03-developer-interface/index.mdx).

### Register the App

To securely connect to Wire, your App needs credentials.
Please follow [steps to onboard your App](./02-manage-apps/01-create-app.md).
