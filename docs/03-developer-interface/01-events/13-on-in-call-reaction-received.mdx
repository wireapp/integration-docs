# `onInCallReactionReceived`

Triggered when received an emoji while in a call.

:::warning

Apps can’t join calls right now, so this event won’t fire.

## Received properties

Along with the [Base properties](01-message-model.md#base-message-properties),
a `WireMessage.InCallEmoji` object includes an `emoji` map.  
The map uses the emoji’s string representation as the key and the number of times that emoji was selected as the value.

Currently, end clients don’t support emoji bundling, so the value is always **1**. Each emoji is sent as its own message.
