# `onMessageReactionReceived`

Triggered when a user reacts to a message.    
Reactions are usually emojis, following the current UI and UX design, but Apps can also use any string as a reaction.  
Multiple reactions can be added to a message and removed from them at any time.

## Received properties

In addition to the [Base properties](01-message-model.md#base-message-properties),
a `WireMessage.Reaction` object includes:

 - **`messageId`** — Identifier of the message the reactions apply to.  
 - **`emojiSet`** — Set of strings representing the sender’s reactions to the message.  
   If empty, all previously added reactions by the same sender are removed.

## Sample usage

### Mirror user’s reaction

```mdx-code-block
import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

<ReactPlayer width="100%" height="400px" controls src='/video/mirror_emojis.mov' />
